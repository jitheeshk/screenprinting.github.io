## Screen Printing

Screen printing is a printing technique whereby a mesh is used to transfer ink onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil. A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact. This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed.

### Steps 

* > First vinyl cut the figure we want to screen print .

* > Now take the mirror of the  figure and stick it onto the frame of the Screen print .

* > Place the Frame onto where we want to screen print and now pour the pani into the back of the frame and spread it evenly .

## Moulding and casting

Molding or moulding is the process of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix.This itself may have been made using a pattern or model of the final object.A mold or mould is a hollowed-out block that is filled with a liquid or pliable material such as plastic, glass, metal, or ceramic raw material.The liquid hardens or sets inside the mold, adopting its shape. A mold is the counterpart to a cast. 

### Steps 

* > Prepare the mould . Mould could be prepared by any of the steps :<br/>
          <b>1. Wax mould</b>
